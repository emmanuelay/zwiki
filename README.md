# Zettlekasten Wiki

The purpose of this project is to provide a web based wiki for a local filesystem folder full of markdown files.
The UI should be inspired by the Zettlekasten method and use tags & links for navigation between cards.

The markdown files should use frontmatter for metadata and markdown for formatting.

## To-do

- [ ] Traverse folder structure and read front matter for all files
- [ ] Tree view to navigate the folder structure
- [ ] View markdown files as HTML
