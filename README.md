# Zettlekasten Wiki

The purpose of this project is to provide a web based wiki for a local filesystem folder containing markdown files. The UI should be inspired by the Zettlekasten method and use tags & links for navigation between nodes.

The markdown files should use frontmatter for metadata and markdown for formatting.

- [ ] Implement edit/update node
- [ ] Implement create new node

- [ ] Read front matter for all files
- [ ] Implement delete node
