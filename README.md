# Zettlekasten Wiki

The purpose of this project is to provide a web based wiki for a local filesystem folder containing markdown files. The UI should be inspired by the Zettlekasten method and use tags & links for navigation between nodes.

The markdown files should use frontmatter for metadata and markdown for formatting.

The intended purpose of this project is to have a simple tool to quickly navigate markdown content in a filesystem.

This can be used to navigate documentation in a software project, as well as keeping a personal knowledgebase/wiki.
